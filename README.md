**"Library Management System with C# (DSA, OOP, Database Integration)"**

**Overview:**
A comprehensive project built using C# to demonstrate the application of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, integrated with a database backend for data persistence.

**Key Features:**

1._**OOP Principles**_: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are used to design and structure the project.

2._**DSA Implementation**_:
Efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and data retrieval.
Custom data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, and trees are used for operations (e.g., managing book data or user requests).

3.**_Database Integration_**:
Uses MS SQL Server as the database for storing and managing data.


**Technologies Used**:

1.Language: C#
2.Frameworks: .NET Framework / .NET Core
